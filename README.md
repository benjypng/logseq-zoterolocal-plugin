# Logseq Zotero Plugin

![](/screenshots/demo.gif)

## Features

- Direct connection to Zotero 7+ without needing to sync with Zotero Cloud
- Customisable templates
- Easy insertion of Zotero items into your graph
- Track which items are already in your graph
- Fuzzy search for the articles that you want to insert

## Installation

1. Recommended: Install from the Logseq marketplace.
2. Alternative: Download a release and manually load it in Logseq.

## Setup

1. Close Logseq.
2. Ensure Zotero 7 is running, and then:
   - In settings, under `Advanced`, check `Allow other applications on this computer to communicate with Zotero`.
   - (only if you want to citation keys) Install [Better Bibtex](https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/releases).
   - In the Better Bibtex section of your Zotero settings, ensure that `Automatically pin citation key after X seconds` is set to `1`.
   - Note: Citation keys need to be **both** set up and pinned in Zotero 7 in order to use citation keys in Logseq. If you have issues setting this up, please seek help at the Zotero or Better Bibtex forums as I may not be as familiar.
   - Restart Zotero.
3. Open Logseq, and then plugin settings.
4. Verify that "Connection to Zotero is working" is checked.
5. Complete the rest of the plugin settings.
